# Distributed System Simulation
The program takes in jobs from the user and sends them to the master. The  master sends the tasks to slaves to be completed. Depending on the current workload of the program, the task goes to a slave that is optimized to execute the job or not. When a slave gets a job it sleeps and then returns completed. The user gets notified that the job has been completed.
